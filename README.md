# CryptoKiller
Anti randsomware tool
this project is used to stop randsomware activity and saving the user's files in order to prevent the payment to save them.
the system is protecting on a single user only and not protecting 100% of the files
*you must change the pathes in order to work in your computer
*the project has to be saved in 'AppData' in order to be protected - because the system is based on the fact that the files there are not being encrypted. 
*to check it save in a diskonkey as an exe file the file "attack2.py" and create a file of a large amount of files (around 1000 that can be encrypted - not important to you) and change the path in "attack2.py" from the file "1" to your file.
*to start it - run "newgui.py" without the diskonkey pluged!!!! and insert the exact path of the user 
after the first run you can start the program using "mainproject5.py" only .
